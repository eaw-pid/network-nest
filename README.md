## Getting Started

To start up the server, cd into the server folder and run `python app.py`. To start up the front end, cd into the client folder and run `npm start`.

## Description

NetworkNest is a full-stack application using Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript and React. This app was inspired by my background working in career services and the strong emphasis we put on networking as a key tool in career exploration and the job search. Users can create an account and keep track of all of their professional contacts. This app uses a Flask API to link the React front end to the backend data.
